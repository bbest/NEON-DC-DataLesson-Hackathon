##Welcome to the NEON / Data Carpentry Hackathon 
### October 21-23 2015

Will revise this text.

This site contains data lessons, background materials and other resources that support working with large spatio-temporal datasets, like those offered by the <a href="http://www.neoninc.org" target="_blank">NEON project</a>. We welcome any comments and feedback that you have and also materials that support or expand upon what's available on this site!.
